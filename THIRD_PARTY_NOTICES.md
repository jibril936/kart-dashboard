# Third-Party Notices

## AnalogGaugeWidgetPyQt
- Upstream: https://github.com/StefanHol/AnalogGaugeWidgetPyQt
- Intended local vendor module: `src/ui/third_party/analoggaugewidget/analoggaugewidget.py`
- License: Apache-2.0 (`third_party/analoggaugewidget/LICENSE`)
- Notes:
  - This dependency is vendorized for the CLUSTER speed gauge integration.
  - In this environment, direct GitHub download was blocked (HTTP 403), so a temporary PyQt6-compatible implementation is stored at the vendor path until upstream file synchronization is possible.
